# NepTUN

**NepTUN** is an implementation of the [WireGuard<sup>®</sup>](https://www.wireguard.com/) protocol designed for portability and speed.

The project consists of two parts:
* The executable `neptun-cli`, a [userspace WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/xplatform/) implementation for Linux and macOS.
* The library `neptun` that can be used to implement fast and efficient WireGuard client apps on various platforms, including iOS and Android. It implements the underlying WireGuard protocol, without the network or tunnel stacks, those can be implemented in a platform idiomatic way.

### Building

- Library only: `cargo build --lib --no-default-features --release [--target $(TARGET_TRIPLE)]`
- Executable: `cargo build --bin neptun-cli --release [--target $(TARGET_TRIPLE)]`

By default the executable is placed in the `./target/release` folder. You can copy it to a desired location manually, or install it using `cargo install --bin neptun --path .`.

### Running

As per the specification, to start a tunnel use:

`neptun-cli [-f/--foreground] INTERFACE-NAME`

The tunnel can then be configured using [wg](https://git.zx2c4.com/WireGuard/about/src/tools/man/wg.8), as a regular WireGuard tunnel, or any other tool.

It is also possible to use with [wg-quick](https://git.zx2c4.com/WireGuard/about/src/tools/man/wg-quick.8) by setting the environment variable `WG_QUICK_USERSPACE_IMPLEMENTATION` to `neptun`. For example:

`sudo WG_QUICK_USERSPACE_IMPLEMENTATION=neptun-cli WG_SUDO=1 wg-quick up CONFIGURATION`

### Testing

Testing this project has a few requirements:

- `sudo`: required to create tunnels. When you run `cargo test` you'll be prompted for your password.
- Docker: you can install it [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started). If you are on Ubuntu/Debian you can run `apt-get install docker.io`.

<sub>Other platforms may be added in the future</sub>

#### Linux

`x86-64`, `aarch64` and `armv7` architectures are supported. The behaviour should be identical to that of [wireguard-go](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-go/about/), with the following difference:

`neptun` will drop privileges when started. When privileges are dropped it is not possible to set `fwmark`. If `fwmark` is required, such as when using `wg-quick`, run with `--disable-drop-privileges` or set the environment variable `WG_SUDO=1`.

You will need to give the executable the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability using: `sudo setcap cap_net_admin+epi neptun`. sudo is not needed.

#### macOS

The behaviour is similar to that of [wireguard-go](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-go/about/). Specifically the interface name must be `utun[0-9]+` for an explicit interface name or `utun` to have the kernel select the lowest available. If you choose `utun` as the interface name, and the environment variable `WG_TUN_NAME_FILE` is defined, then the actual name of the interface chosen by the kernel is written to the file specified by that variable.
